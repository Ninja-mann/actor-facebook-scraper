## Why scrape Facebook posts? 

Our free Facebook Posts Scraper allows scraping the most recent posts (with or without comments) from one or multiple chosen Facebook pages. Scraping the most recent Facebook posts can automate data collection to spot shifts in customer attitudes, analyze social media phenomena and their influence, identify hot spots of misinformation, fake news, hate speech, and more.

If you are unsure how your business or project could use the data scraped from Facebook posts, you can browse through our [industries pages](https://apify.com/industries)  for ideas and use cases.
